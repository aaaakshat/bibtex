abstract = {There are three types of limitations to measurements: 1) Instrumental limitations Any measuring device can only be used to measure to with a certain degree of fineness. Our measurements are no better than the instruments we use to make them. 2) Systematic errors and blunders These are caused by a mistake which does not change during the measurement. For example, if the platform balance you used to weigh something was not correctly set to zero with no weight on the pan, all your subsequent measurements of mass would be too large. Systematic errors do not enter into the uncertainty. They are either identified and eliminated or lurk in the background producing a shift from the true value. 3) Random errors These arise from unnoticed variations in measurement technique, tiny changes in the experimental environment, etc. Random variations affect precision. Truly random effects average out if the results of a large number of trials are combined. Precision vs. Accuracy  A precise measurement is one where independent measurements of the same quantity closely cluster about a single value that may or may not be the correct value.  An accurate measurement is one where independent measurements cluster about the true value of the measured quantity. Systematic errors are not random and therefore can never cancel out. They affect the accuracy but not the precision of a measurement. A. Low-precision, Low-accuracy: The average (the X) is not close to the center B. Low-precision, High-accuracy: The average is close to the true value C. High-precision, Low-accuracy: The average is not close to the true value},
