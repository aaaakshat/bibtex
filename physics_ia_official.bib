abstract = {Physics 1120 Uncertainty Propagation 1. Round the following to the correct number of significant figures: (a) 71.85234 ± 0.02672 (b) 13.6 ± 0.210 (c) 0.0044667 ± 0.000081 Recall that we keep two digits if the first non­zero digit of the uncertainty is a 1 or a 2. (a) 71.852 ± 0.027 (b) 13.60 ± 0.21 (c) 0.00447 ± 0.00008 2. Apply error propagation rules to the following: a. Let A = 79.5 ± 0.6, B = 27.8 ± 0.4, and C = 54.6 ± 0.3. Evaluate F = A ­ B + C. First we determine the principle value, P(F) = P(A) ­ P(B) + P(C) = 79.5 ­ 27.8 + 54.6 = 106.3. Using the rule for addition and subtraction, the uncertainty is given by $\delta$(F) = $\delta$(A ­ B + C) = [($\delta$A) 2 + ($\delta$B) 2 + ($\delta$C) 2 ] ½ = [(0.6) 2 + (0.4) 2 + (0.3) 2 ] ½ = 0.78 Thus F = 106.3 ± 0.78 = 106.3 ± 0.8. b. Let A = ­12.1 ± 0.2 and B = 3.45 ± 0.06. Evaluate F = A/B. First we determine the principle value, P(F) = P(A)/P(B) = ­12.1/3.45 = ­3.5072. Using the rule for multiplication and division, the uncertainty is given by},

@techreport{Dean2017,
abstract = {A theoretical analysis is presented, showing the derivations of seven different linearization equations for the conical pendulum period T, as a function of radial and angular parameters. Experimental data obtained over a large range of fixed conical pendulum lengths (0.435 m-2.130 m) are plotted with the theoretical lines and demonstrate excellent agreement. Two of the seven derived linearization equations were considered to be especially useful in terms of student understanding and relative mathematical simplicity. These linear analysis methods consistently gave an agreement of approximately 1.5% between the theoretical and experimental values for g, the acceleration due to gravity. An equation is derived theoretically (from two different starting equations), showing that the conical pendulum length L appropriate for a second pendulum can only occur within a defined limit: L  [ g / (4  2)]. It is therefore possible to calculate the appropriate circular radius R or apex angle (0     / 2) for any length L in the calculated limit, so that the conical pendulum will have a one second period. A general equation is also derived for the period T, for periods other than one second.},
