abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a well researched natural language processing field. It is a challenging machine learning task due to the recursive nature of sentences, different length of documents and sarcasm. Traditional approaches to sentiment analysis use count or frequency of words in the text which are assigned sentiment value by some expert. These approaches disregard the order of words and the complex meanings they can convey. Gated Recurrent Units are recent form of recurrent neural network which have the ability to store information of long term dependencies in sequential data. In this work we showed that GRU are suitable for processing long textual data and applied it to the task of sentiment analysis. We showed its effectiveness by comparing with tf-idf and word2vec models. We also showed that GRUs are faster in convergence than LSTM, another gating network. We applied a number of modifications to the standard GRU to make it train faster and yet less prone to over training. We found the better performimg hyperparameters of the GRU-net through extensive cross-validation testing. Finally we ensembled the best performing GRU models for even better performance.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art studies on cyberbullying detection, using text classification, predominantly take it for granted that streaming text can be completely labelled. However, the rapid growth of unlabelled data generated in real time from online content renders this virtually impossible. In this paper, we propose a session-based framework for automatic detection of cyberbullying within the large volume of unlabelled streaming text. Given that the streaming data from Social Networks arrives in large volume at the server system, we incorporate an ensemble of one-class classifiers in the session-based framework. System uses Multi-Agent distributed environment to process streaming data from multiple social network sources. The proposed strategy tackles real world situations, where only a few positive instances of cyberbullying are available for initial training. Our main contribution in this paper is to automatically detect cyberbullying in real world situations, where labelled data is not re},

abstract = {While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a cyberbullying corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for the task. Experiments on a hold-out test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1 score of 64{\%} and 61{\%} for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems.},

abstract = {The use of new technologies along with the popularity of social networks has given the power of anonymity to the users. The ability to create an alter-ego with no relation to the actual user, creates a situation in which no one can certify the match between a profile and a real person. This problem generates situations, repeated daily, in which users with fake accounts, or at least not related to their real identity, publish news, reviews or multimedia material trying to discredit or attack other people who may or may not be aware of the attack. These acts can have great impact on the affected victims' environment generating situations in which virtual attacks escalate intofatal consequences in real life. In this article, we present a methodology to detect and associate fake profiles on Twitter social network which are employed for defamatory activities to a real profile within the same network by analysing the content of the comments generated by both profiles.

abstract = {Energy prediction models are used in buildings as a performance evaluation engine in advanced control and optimisation, and in making informed decisions by facility managers and utilities for enhanced energy efficiency. Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction – for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.},

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the two main types of DNN architectures, are widely explored to handle various NLP tasks. CNN is supposed to be good at extracting position-invariant features and RNN at modeling units in sequence. The state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks often switches due to the battle of CNNs and RNNs. This work is the first systematic comparison of CNN and RNN on a wide range of representative NLP tasks, aiming to give basic guidance for DNN selection.},

abstract = {Cyber bullying is the use of technology as a medium to bully someone. Although it has been an issue for many years, the recognition of its impact on young people has recently increased. Social networking sites provide a fertile medium for bullies, and teens and young adults who use these sites are vulnerable to attacks. Through machine learning, we can detect language patterns used by bullies and their victims, and develop rules to automatically detect cyber bullying content. The data we used for our project was collected from the website Formspring.me, a question-and-answer formatted website that contains a high percentage of bullying content. The data was labeled using a web service, Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We used the labeled data, in conjunction with machine learning techniques provided by the Weka tool kit, to train a computer to recognize bullying content. Both a C4.5 decision tree learner and an instance-based learner were able to identify the true positives with 78.5{\%} accuracy.},
