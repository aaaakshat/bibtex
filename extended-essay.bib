abstract = {Deep Learning is a state-of-the-art technique to make inference on extensive or complex data. As a black box model due to their multilayer nonlinear structure, Deep Neural Networks are often criticized to be non-transparent and their predictions not traceable by humans. Furthermore, the models learn from artificial datasets, often with bias or contaminated discriminating content. Through their increased distribution, decision-making algorithms can contribute promoting prejudge and unfairness which is not easy to notice due to lack of transparency. Hence, scientists developed several so-called explanators or explainers which try to point out the connection between input and output to represent in a simplified way the inner structure of machine learning black boxes. In this survey we differ the mechanisms and properties of explaining systems for Deep Neural Networks for Computer Vision tasks. We give a comprehensive overview about taxonomy of related studies and compare several survey papers that deal with explainability in general. We work out the drawbacks and gaps and summarize further research ideas.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a well researched natural language processing field. It is a challenging machine learning task due to the recursive nature of sentences, different length of documents and sarcasm. Traditional approaches to sentiment analysis use count or frequency of words in the text which are assigned sentiment value by some expert. These approaches disregard the order of words and the complex meanings they can convey. Gated Recurrent Units are recent form of recurrent neural network which have the ability to store information of long term dependencies in sequential data. In this work we showed that GRU are suitable for processing long textual data and applied it to the task of sentiment analysis. We showed its effectiveness by comparing with tf-idf and word2vec models. We also showed that GRUs are faster in convergence than LSTM, another gating network. We applied a number of modifications to the standard GRU to make it train faster and yet less prone to over training. We found the better performimg hyperparameters of the GRU-net through extensive cross-validation testing. Finally we ensembled the best performing GRU models for even better performance.},

The ability to create an alter-ego with no relation to the actual user, creates a situation in which no one can certify the match between a profile and a real person. This problem generates situations, repeated daily, in which users with fake accounts, or at least not related to their real identity, publish news, reviews or multimedia material trying to discredit or attack other people who may or may not be aware of the attack. These acts can have great impact on the affected victims' environment generating situations in which virtual attacks escalate intofatal consequences in real life.

abstract = {Deep neural networks have been successfully used in diverse emerging domains to solve real world complex problems with may more deep learning(DL) architectures, being developed to date. To achieve these state-of-the-art performances, the DL architectures use activation functions (AFs), to perform diverse computations between the hidden layers and the output layers of any given DL architecture. This paper presents a survey on the existing AFs used in deep learning applications and highlights the recent trends in the use of the activation functions for deep learning applications. The novelty of this paper is that it compiles majority of the AFs used in DL and outlines the current trends in the applications and usage of these functions in practical deep learning deployments against the state-of-the-art research results. This compilation will aid in making effective decisions in the choice of the most suitable and appropriate activation function for any given application, ready for deployment. This paper is timely because most research papers on AF highlights similar works and results while this paper will be the first, to compile the trends in AF applications in practice against the research results from literature, found in deep learning research to date.},

abstract = {While social media offer great communication opportunities, they also increase the vulnerability of young people to threatening situations online. Recent studies report that cyberbullying constitutes a growing problem among youngsters. Successful prevention depends on the adequate detection of potentially harmful messages and the information overload on the Web requires intelligent systems to identify potential risks automatically. The focus of this paper is on automatic cyberbullying detection in social media text by modelling posts written by bullies, victims, and bystanders of online bullying. We describe the collection and fine-grained annotation of a cyberbullying corpus for English and Dutch and perform a series of binary classification experiments to determine the feasibility of automatic cyberbullying detection. We make use of linear support vector machines exploiting a rich feature set and investigate which information sources contribute the most for the task. Experiments on a hold-out test set reveal promising results for the detection of cyberbullying-related posts. After optimisation of the hyperparameters, the classifier yields an F1 score of 64{\%} and 61{\%} for English and Dutch respectively, and considerably outperforms baseline systems.},

In this paper, we propose a session-based framework for automatic detection of cyberbullying within the large volume of unlabelled streaming text. Given that the streaming data from Social Networks arrives in large volume at the server system, we incorporate an ensemble of one-class classifiers in the session-based framework. System uses Multi-Agent distributed environment to process streaming data from multiple social network sources.

Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction – for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications.},

abstract = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of "unrolling" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the "Vanilla LSTM" 1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical opti-misation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a non-negligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},
